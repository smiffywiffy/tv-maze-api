# Tv Maze API Test

Hello Code Fans,

I have managed to get a couple of pages hooked up and styled.
However, as I am relatively new to React world, I could not
set up Redux in a short space of time. I understand the principles
of it but could not get anything basic set up, so I concentrated
on other areas of the requirements.

Also, I would of liked to have coded in Typescript and added some
Jest tests but this is also new for me.

I could obviously improve the code over a few days but the requirements were for no
more than six hours.

Overall, you can see I am still 'work in progress' when it comes to more
advanced front-end development.

Yours sincerely

Smiffy
